# Carbonization
- test
## ok

- Carbonization is a **pyrolytic reaction**
- Complex process involving concurrent reactions:
  - **Dehydrogenation**
  - **Condensation**
  - **Hydrogen transfer**
  - **Isomerization**
- Differs from coalification:
  - Faster reaction rate by many orders of magnitude
- Final pyrolysis temperature controls:
  - Degree of carbonization
  - Residual content of foreign elements
